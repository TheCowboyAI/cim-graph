# CIM Module Production Readiness Standards

## Overview

This document defines the standards that all CIM modules must meet to be considered production-ready. Currently, only four modules meet these standards:
- `cim-ipld`
- `cim-component`
- `cim-subject`
- `cim-domain`

All other modules are in development and will be brought up to these standards one at a time.

## Production Readiness Criteria

### 1. Code Quality Standards

#### Documentation
- [ ] Complete README.md with:
  - Clear module purpose and scope
  - Installation instructions
  - Usage examples
  - API documentation links
  - License information
- [ ] Inline code documentation for all public APIs
- [ ] Architecture decision records (ADRs) for key design choices
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md tracking all versions

#### Code Structure
- [ ] Clear module organization following Rust conventions
- [ ] Single responsibility principle enforced
- [ ] All public APIs properly exported
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] Consistent error handling patterns

#### Testing
- [ ] Unit test coverage â‰¥ 80%
- [ ] Integration tests for all major features
- [ ] Property-based tests where applicable
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for critical paths
- [ ] All tests passing in CI

### 2. Repository Standards

#### Version Control
- [ ] Semantic versioning (SemVer) strictly followed
- [ ] Git tags for all releases
- [ ] Protected main branch
- [ ] Commit messages follow conventional commits
- [ ] Clean git history (no merge commits on main)

#### CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow for:
  - Build and test on push
  - Cross-platform testing (Linux, macOS, Windows)
  - Security scanning
  - License compliance checking
  - Documentation generation
- [ ] Automated release process
- [ ] Registry notification on updates

#### Repository Files
- [ ] LICENSE file (Apache-2.0 or MIT)
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines
- [ ] CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- [ ] SECURITY.md with vulnerability reporting
- [ ] .gitignore properly configured
- [ ] rust-toolchain.toml for version pinning

### 3. Module Metadata

#### cim.yaml Requirements
```yaml
module:
  name: "cim-example"
  type: "core|domain|integration|utility"
  version: "1.0.0"
  description: "Clear, concise description"
  status: "production"
  category: "appropriate-category"
  maintainers:
    - name: "Maintainer Name"
      github: "@username"
  dependencies:
    cim-domain: "^1.0"
    # All dependencies with version constraints
  keywords:
    - "relevant"
    - "searchable"
    - "terms"
```

#### Cargo.toml Standards
- [ ] Complete package metadata
- [ ] All dependencies with explicit versions
- [ ] Feature flags documented
- [ ] Examples included
- [ ] Benchmarks configured

### 4. API Design

#### Public API Requirements
- [ ] Stable API with no breaking changes in minor versions
- [ ] All types implement standard traits (Debug, Clone, etc.)
- [ ] Builder patterns for complex types
- [ ] Async-first design where appropriate
- [ ] Proper error types (not string errors)

#### Error Handling
```rust
#[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)]
pub enum ModuleError {
    #[error("Configuration error: {0}")]
    Configuration(String),
    
    #[error("Operation failed: {0}")]
    Operation(#[from] OperationError),
    
    // Specific, actionable errors
}
```

### 5. Security Standards

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Input validation on all public APIs
- [ ] Safe handling of untrusted data
- [ ] Dependencies audited (cargo audit)
- [ ] SAST scanning passing
- [ ] No unsafe code without justification

### 6. Performance Standards

- [ ] Benchmarks for critical operations
- [ ] Memory usage within defined limits
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] Efficient algorithms (documented complexity)
- [ ] Async operations properly implemented

### 7. Integration Standards

#### NATS Integration
- [ ] Proper subject naming conventions
- [ ] Error handling for network failures
- [ ] Reconnection logic implemented
- [ ] Message schemas documented

#### Event Sourcing
- [ ] Events follow CIM event standards
- [ ] Proper correlation/causation tracking
- [ ] Event versioning strategy
- [ ] Replay capability tested

### 8. Deployment Readiness

- [ ] Docker image available (if applicable)
- [ ] Nix package definition
- [ ] Configuration via environment variables
- [ ] Health check endpoints
- [ ] Metrics and observability hooks
- [ ] Graceful shutdown handling

## Migration Path

For modules currently in development:

1. **Assessment**: Evaluate against this checklist
2. **Planning**: Create issues for missing items
3. **Implementation**: Work through items systematically
4. **Review**: Code review by maintainers
5. **Testing**: Extended testing period
6. **Release**: Version 1.0.0 and production status

## Production-Ready Module Examples

### cim-domain
- Clean API design with traits and generics
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Full documentation
- Stable since v1.0.0

### cim-ipld
- Well-defined content addressing interface
- Performance optimized
- Security audited
- Integration tested

### cim-component
- Clear ECS component patterns
- Type-safe design
- Extensive examples
- Production deployments

### cim-subject
- Event algebra fully specified
- Message routing patterns documented
- Battle-tested in production
- Performance benchmarked

## Maintenance Requirements

Once a module achieves production status:
- Security updates within 48 hours
- Bug fixes within 1 week
- Feature requests evaluated monthly
- Breaking changes require major version bump
- Deprecation notices 2 versions in advance

## Review Process

1. Self-assessment by module maintainer
2. Independent review by CIM team
3. Testing in reference implementation
4. Community feedback period
5. Production status approval

## Tracking Progress

The registry tracks module status:
- `template`: Starting templates
- `development`: Active development, not production-ready
- `production`: Meets all standards, stable API
- `deprecated`: No longer maintained

Query current status:
```bash
./scripts/query-modules.sh --status production
```
