# Current CIM Project State

## Last Sync with progress.json
- **Date**: 2025-01-30
- **Overall Completion**: 25%
- **Active Domain**: Documentation (COMPLETE)

## Current Focus
Based on progress.json analysis:
- All documentation nodes are COMPLETE
- No implementation nodes exist yet
- Next priorities indicate infrastructure and core implementation needed

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Create infrastructure setup nodes
2. Implement NATS client foundation
3. Set up leaf node configuration
4. Create service templates

## Node Creation Queue
```json
[
  {
    "id": "nats-infrastructure",
    "type": "infrastructure",
    "description": "Basic NATS server setup and configuration"
  },
  {
    "id": "nats-client-core",
    "type": "implementation",
    "description": "Core NATS client with connection management"
  },
  {
    "id": "leaf-node-setup",
    "type": "infrastructure",
    "description": "Leaf node configuration and service hosting"
  }
]
```

## Context Switch Triggers
- When starting new implementation domain
- After completing current node
- When blocked on dependencies
- When user requests specific focus area

## Memory Sync Protocol
1. Always read progress.json before major work
2. Update this file when context switching
3. Reflect accurate project state
4. Track active work in todos
5. Update progress.json after task completion
