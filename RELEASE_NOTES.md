# Release Notes for CIM Graph v0.1.0

## üéâ Initial Release

We are excited to announce the first public release of CIM Graph, a unified graph abstraction library that consolidates all graph operations across the CIM ecosystem.

## Overview

CIM Graph provides a high-performance, type-safe graph library that unifies multiple graph paradigms under a single, consistent API. This release includes five specialized graph types, comprehensive algorithms, and a robust event-driven architecture.

## Key Features

### üî∏ Five Specialized Graph Types

1. **IpldGraph** - Content-addressed graphs for IPLD data structures
   - Block storage with content addressing
   - Link management between blocks
   - Compatible with IPFS/IPLD ecosystem

2. **ContextGraph** - Domain-Driven Design bounded contexts
   - Aggregate roots and entities
   - Relationship management
   - Domain event support

3. **WorkflowGraph** - State machine workflows
   - State transitions
   - Workflow validation
   - Parallel workflow support

4. **ConceptGraph** - Semantic reasoning and knowledge graphs
   - Concept hierarchies
   - Semantic relations (IsA, PartOf, etc.)
   - Inference capabilities

5. **ComposedGraph** - Multi-layer graph composition
   - Cross-graph queries
   - Layer management
   - Unified operations across graph types

### üî∏ Graph Algorithms

- **Pathfinding**: Shortest path, all paths between nodes
- **Traversal**: DFS, BFS, topological sorting
- **Analysis**: Centrality metrics, clustering coefficients
- **Pattern Matching**: Graph pattern detection (coming in v0.2)

### üî∏ Event-Driven Architecture

- All graph operations emit events
- Custom event handlers
- Event sourcing support
- Audit trail capabilities

### üî∏ Serialization Support

- JSON serialization/deserialization
- Binary format support
- Schema evolution
- Round-trip guarantees

### üî∏ Performance Features

- Graph indexing for O(1) lookups
- Caching for expensive computations
- Parallel operations with rayon
- Memory pooling
- Optimized for graphs up to 1M+ nodes

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
- Built on `petgraph` v0.8 for proven graph algorithms
- `serde` for serialization
- `rayon` for parallel processing
- `thiserror` for error handling
- `uuid` for unique identifiers
- `chrono` for timestamps

### Platform Support
- Rust 1.70+ (stable, beta, nightly)
- Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- `no_std` support planned for v0.2

### Performance Characteristics
- Node operations: O(1) with indexing
- Edge operations: O(1) amortized
- Memory usage: ~100 bytes per node + edges
- Supports graphs with millions of nodes

## Getting Started

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
cim-graph = "0.1.0"
```

Quick example:
```rust
use cim_graph::graphs::workflow::{WorkflowGraph, WorkflowNode, StateType};

let mut graph = WorkflowGraph::new();
let start = WorkflowNode::new("start", "Start", StateType::Start);
let end = WorkflowNode::new("end", "End", StateType::End);

graph.add_state(start)?;
graph.add_state(end)?;
graph.add_transition("start", "end", "complete")?;
```

## Testing

This release includes comprehensive testing:
- ‚úÖ 100+ unit tests
- ‚úÖ Integration test suite
- ‚úÖ Property-based tests with proptest
- ‚úÖ Fuzz testing with libfuzzer
- ‚úÖ Stress tests up to 1M nodes
- ‚úÖ Concurrency tests
