# Composable Information Machine (CIM)

A continuously improving, distributed system that transforms scattered information into organized, actionable, reactive knowledge while keeping it secure and accessible across your digital world.

A CIM is an encapsulation of knowledge, specialized, and partitioned by Domain. A CIM is designed to compose many Domains and efficiently create workflows and transitions between them.

You **MUST** READ AND FOLLOW ./.claude/INDEX.md
You **MUST** read doc/progress/progress.json (creating it if it does not exist)

ALL Work must create a node in the progress graph structure and update metrics accordingly.

## Project Overview

**Alchemist** is a revolutionary 3D graph visualization and editing system that serves as the primary interface for the **Composable Information Machine (CIM)**. It's built in Rust using Bevy Engine and Iced with a strict event-driven architecture and several fully implemented domain modules.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Design Principles
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Everything is an event, zero CRUD operations
- **Domain-Driven Design**: 14+ domains with clear boundaries
- **CQRS Pattern**: Separate read/write models with eventual consistency
- **ECS Integration**: Bevy Entity Component System for 3D visualization
- **Distributed Systems**: NATS messaging with JetStream persistence

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Rust (Nightly 2024+)
- **Runtime**: Tokio async runtime
- **Visualization**: Bevy Engine 0.16+ (patched version)
- **Messaging**: NATS with JetStream
- **Build System**: Cargo workspace with 23+ crates

### Domain Structure
The system is organized into 14 production-ready domains:

1. **Graph Domain** (`cim-domain-graph`) - Core graph operations, spatial positioning
2. **Agent Domain** (`cim-domain-agent`) - AI provider integration, semantic search
3. **Workflow Domain** (`cim-domain-workflow`) - Business process execution, state machines
4. **ConceptualSpaces Domain** (`cim-domain-conceptual-spaces`) - Semantic reasoning, quality dimensions
5. **Identity Domain** (`cim-domain-identity`) - Person/organization management
6. **Location Domain** (`cim-domain-location`) - Geospatial data, hierarchical locations
7. **Document Domain** (`cim-domain-document`) - Document lifecycle, version control
8. **Git Domain** (`cim-domain-git`) - Repository integration, commit tracking
9. **Dialog Domain** (`cim-domain-dialog`) - Conversation tracking
10. **Policy Domain** (`cim-domain-policy`) - Business rule enforcement
11. **Nix Domain** (`cim-domain-nix`) - Infrastructure as code
12. **Organization Domain** (`cim-domain-organization`) - Hierarchy management
13. **Person Domain** (`cim-domain-person`) - Contact management, relationships
14. **Bevy Domain** (`cim-domain-bevy`) - ECS visualization layer

### Key Technical Innovations
- **CID Chains**: Cryptographic integrity for events
- **Dual ECS Systems**: Domain logic + visualization
- **Conceptual Spaces**: 5D semantic reasoning engine
- **Self-Referential**: System can visualize itself
- **Event Sourcing**: Perfect audit trail, time-travel debugging

## Development Rules (from .cursorrules)

### **MANDATORY TDD WORKFLOW**
You **MUST** follow this exact sequence for ALL development work:

1. **Write User Stories** - Clear, testable requirements
2. **Expand to Tests** - Convert user stories into failing tests
3. **Fulfill Tests** - Implement code to make tests pass
4. **Update Progress** - Track completion in progress.json

**NO CODE IS WRITTEN WITHOUT TESTS FIRST**

### TDD Process Example
```rust
// 1. User Story: "As a user, I want to create a graph node"
// 2. Test First:
#[test]
fn test_create_graph_node() {
    let mut graph = Graph::new();
    let node_id = graph.create_node("test_node");
    assert!(graph.contains_node(&node_id));
}
// 3. Then implement Graph::create_node() to make test pass
```

### Naming Conventions
- **Filenames**: ALL lowercase with underscores (snake_case)
- **Functions**: snake_case
- **Types**: PascalCase
- **Constants**: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE

### Architecture Patterns
- **Event-First Design**: Everything must be an event
- **Domain Isolation**: No shared state between domains
- **Single Responsibility**: Each element has one responsibility
- **Dependency Injection**: Inject dependencies, don't create them
- **Test-Driven Development**: Tests must pass before implementation

### Code Organization
- Each domain is a separate crate with clear boundaries
- All domains follow the same internal structure (events, commands, queries, handlers)
- Use `cim-core` for shared types and utilities
- Bevy systems are in `cim-domain-bevy` for visualization

## Performance Benchmarks

The system has exceeded all performance targets:
- Event Creation: 779,352/sec (7.8x target)
- Event Publishing: 1,013,638/sec (101x target)
- Concurrent Operations: 2,389,116/sec
- Query Response: <10ms (15x faster)
- Memory Usage: 1.3KB/event (7.5x better)

## Testing Infrastructure

- **499+ Tests** (100% passing)
- **Unit Tests**: 460+ tests across all domains
- **Integration Tests**: 25 comprehensive tests
- **Performance Tests**: 6 benchmark tests
- **Error Handling**: 8 comprehensive error tests
