# Coverage Summary

## Overall Coverage: 76.41%

### Module Coverage Breakdown:

| Module | Coverage | Covered/Total |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| src/core | 71.72% | 657/916 |
| src/algorithms | 63.48% | 229/361 |
| src/graphs | 78.75% | 968/1229 |
| src/performance | 80.66% | 146/181 |
| src/serde_support | 73.06% | 50/88 |
| src/error.rs | 100.00% | 3/3 |
| src/lib.rs | 97.59% | 162/166 |

### Key Improvements:
- Event system: Now has test coverage (was 0%)
- Performance module: Added comprehensive tests for NodePool, parallel operations, and PerfCounter
- Serialization: Added file operations and helper function tests
- Overall coverage increased from 73.37% to 76.41%

### Remaining Areas for Improvement:
- Algorithms module (63.48%) - particularly pathfinding and metrics
- Some graph implementations have lower coverage (composed: 63.06%)
- Core petgraph_impl (52.09%) needs more test coverage

### Test Summary:
- 73 tests passed
- 0 failed
- 4 ignored (serialization tests for graphs not yet implemented)
- 0 errors, 0 warnings in library code
