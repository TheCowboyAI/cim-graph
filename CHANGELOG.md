## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2025-08-04

### Added
- Initial release of CIM Graph library
- Core graph abstraction with event-driven architecture
- Five specialized graph types:
  - `IpldGraph` - Content-addressed graph for IPLD data structures
  - `ContextGraph` - Domain-driven design bounded contexts
  - `WorkflowGraph` - State machine workflows
  - `ConceptGraph` - Semantic reasoning and knowledge graphs
  - `ComposedGraph` - Multi-layer graph composition
- Graph algorithms:
  - Pathfinding (shortest path, all paths)
  - Traversal (DFS, BFS, topological sort)
  - Analysis (centrality, clustering coefficient)
- Serialization support:
  - JSON format with pretty printing
  - Binary format for efficiency
  - Schema evolution support
- Comprehensive test suite with 88+ tests
- Performance benchmarks
- Full documentation and examples

### Architecture
- Built on petgraph v0.8 for proven graph algorithms
- Event-driven design for extensibility
- Type-safe API with strong Rust types
- Zero-copy operations where possible
- Async-ready architecture (feature flag)

### Dependencies
- `petgraph` 0.8 - Core graph algorithms
- `serde` 1.0 - Serialization framework
- `uuid` 1.6 - Unique identifiers
- `chrono` 0.4 - Timestamp handling
- `thiserror` 1.0 - Error handling
