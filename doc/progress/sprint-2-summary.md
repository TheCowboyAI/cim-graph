# Sprint 2 Summary

## Overview
Sprint 2 focused on implementing edge operations and graph queries (US-003 and US-004), with a major architectural change to use petgraph as the underlying graph engine.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Petgraph Integration
- Refactored the entire implementation to use petgraph v0.8 as the underlying graph engine
- Created an event-driven wrapper (`EventGraph`) around petgraph's `DiGraph`
- Maintained our custom Node and Edge traits while leveraging petgraph's efficient algorithms

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture
- Implemented a comprehensive event system for all graph operations
- Created `GraphEvent` enum covering all graph mutations
- Added `EventHandler` trait for custom event processing
- Included `MemoryEventHandler` for testing and debugging

### 3. Edge Operations (US-003)
- ✅ Add edges between nodes with validation
- ✅ Support multiple edges between same nodes
- ✅ Handle edge removal
- ✅ Automatic edge cleanup when nodes are removed
- ✅ Support for self-loops
- ✅ Duplicate edge ID detection

### 4. Graph Queries (US-004)
- ✅ Query neighbors (outgoing connections)
- ✅ Query predecessors (incoming connections)
- ✅ Get node degree (out-degree)
- ✅ Get total degree (all connections)
- ✅ Query edges between specific nodes
- ✅ Graph statistics (node/edge counts)

## Technical Details

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Petgraph as Engine**: Instead of reimplementing graph algorithms, we wrap petgraph to get battle-tested performance
2. **String IDs**: Maintained string-based IDs for nodes/edges while internally mapping to petgraph's NodeIndex
3. **Event System**: Every mutation emits an event, enabling reactive patterns and audit trails
4. **Dual APIs**: Both `BasicGraph` (simple) and `EventGraph` (event-driven) available

### New Components
- `EventGraph<N, E>`: Main graph implementation using petgraph
- `GraphEvent`: Enumeration of all possible graph events
- `EventHandler`: Trait for handling graph events
- `MemoryEventHandler`: Simple event collector for testing

### API Improvements
- `GraphBuilder::build_event()`: Create event-driven graphs
- `graph.add_handler()`: Register event handlers
- `graph.petgraph()`: Access underlying petgraph for advanced operations
- `graph.predecessors()`: Query incoming connections
- `graph.edges_between()`: Get all edges between two nodes

## Testing
- 31 acceptance tests covering US-001 through US-004
- 6 integration tests for event system
- 13 unit tests
- Total: 50 tests passing

## Code Quality
- All tests passing
- Consistent use of Result<T> for error handling
- Comprehensive error types for all failure cases
- Event-driven architecture enables debugging and monitoring

## Next Steps (Sprint 3)
- Implement type-specific graphs (IpldGraph, ContextGraph, WorkflowGraph, ConceptGraph)
- Add graph serialization/deserialization
- Implement graph composition
- Add advanced query capabilities
