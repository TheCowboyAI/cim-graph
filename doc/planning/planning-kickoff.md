# CIM Graph - Planning Phase Kickoff

## Overview

This document marks the transition from DESIGN to PLANNING phase for the CIM Graph project. All design artifacts are complete, and we're ready to plan the implementation.

## Design Phase Summary

### Completed Artifacts

1. **Core Design**
   - Unified graph abstraction design
   - Four specialized graph types (IPLD, Context, Workflow, Concept)
   - Composition and transformation capabilities

2. **Requirements**
   - 8 user stories with graph-based specifications
   - 12 comprehensive acceptance tests
   - Complete test strategy

3. **Architecture**
   - Domain model with 7 aggregates
   - Event-driven architecture with state machines
   - API contracts for all operations

4. **Implementation**
   - 8-week implementation plan
   - Development workflow defined
   - Aggregate transaction tests specified

## Planning Phase Goals

### 1. Sprint Planning

Break down the 8-week implementation plan into 2-week sprints:

- **Sprint 1**: Core foundation (US-001, US-002)
- **Sprint 2**: Edge operations and queries (US-003, US-004)
- **Sprint 3**: Type-specific implementations
- **Sprint 4**: Composition and transformation (US-005, US-007)

### 2. Resource Allocation

**Team Structure**:
- 2 Senior Rust developers
- 1 Graph algorithm specialist
- 1 DevOps engineer (part-time)

**Infrastructure Needs**:
- GitHub repository with CI/CD
- Rust development environment
- Benchmark infrastructure
- Documentation hosting

### 3. Development Environment

**Required Setup**:
```bash
# Rust toolchain
rustup default stable
rustup component add rustfmt clippy

# Development dependencies
cargo install cargo-watch
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin
cargo install cargo-criterion
```

### 4. Sprint 1 Planning (Weeks 1-2)

**Goal**: Establish core graph infrastructure

**User Stories**:
- US-001: Create Basic Graph
- US-002: Add Nodes to Graph

**Tasks**:
1. Set up project structure
2. Implement base Graph trait
3. Create GraphBuilder factory
4. Implement node storage
5. Add node operations
6. Create unit tests
7. Set up CI pipeline

**Deliverables**:
- Working Graph struct with generics
- Node addition/removal operations
- 95% test coverage
- CI/CD pipeline operational

### 5. Risk Management

**Identified Risks**:
1. **Type system complexity** - Mitigate with incremental implementation
2. **Performance with large graphs** - Early benchmarking strategy
3. **API stability** - Comprehensive testing before v1.0

### 6. Success Metrics

**Sprint 1 Success Criteria**:
- [ ] All US-001 acceptance tests pass
- [ ] All US-002 acceptance tests pass
- [ ] Code coverage > 95%
- [ ] CI pipeline green
- [ ] Benchmark baselines established

## Communication Plan

### Daily Standups
- Time: 9:00 AM PST
- Duration: 15 minutes
- Focus: Progress on user stories

### Sprint Planning
- Every 2 weeks
- Review upcoming stories
- Estimate tasks
- Assign work

### Sprint Review
- End of each sprint
- Demo completed features
- Gather feedback
- Update plans

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Create GitHub project board
   - Set up development environment
   - Initialize Rust project structure
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline

2. **Sprint 1 Day 1**:
   - Team kickoff meeting
   - Environment setup
   - Begin US-001 implementation

3. **Ongoing**:
   - Daily progress updates
   - Update event store
   - Maintain documentation

## Definition of Ready

Before starting any user story:
- [ ] Acceptance tests defined
- [ ] API contracts specified
- [ ] Dependencies identified
- [ ] Task breakdown complete

## Definition of Done

For each user story:
- [ ] All acceptance tests pass
- [ ] Unit test coverage > 95%
- [ ] API documentation complete
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Performance benchmarks pass
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities

## Phase Transition

With this kickoff document, we officially transition from DESIGN to PLANNING phase. The next event in our event store will mark this transition.
